[Linux]
Use make install as directed in the README file.

[Windows: With GNU Make (MSYS)]
"make install" from within the MSYS shell should properly install
the library if you installed FreeBASIC to the default directory.
If you did not use the default directory you will need to pass:
	INSTALLDIR=/c/freebasic
or what ever path you installed FreeBASIC to in MSYS style.

[Windows: Without GNU Make]
Copy the inc and lib directories and paste them into the root
of your FreeBASIC directory (by default its C:\Program Files\FreeBASIC).
They will not overwrite any files included with FreeBASIC. You 
should copy the contents of the bin directory to C:\WINDOWS\System32
for maximum compatibility. They can also be located in your project's
directory. You must remember to distribute any dlls you use with your project.

## Building the libraries from source

To build and install the library, you must have a GNU Make-compatible program.

Windows users can use MSYS, which can be found here https://www.msys.org

Linux users typically have GNU Make-compatible program already on the system.
Also, development packages of some external libraries may be needed to build
the FreeBASIC Extended Library on Linux (see [Dependencies] below).

To build the libraries, enter the root dir--the one containing this file--and
type the following commands,

	make
	make MT=1

This will build two static libraries: a single- and a multi- threaded version.
The multi-threaded version of the library need not be built if the library is
not going to be used in a multi-threaded application.

To install the libraries, enter the root dir and type,

	make install

Linux users may need to run the command with root privilages. This will install
the libraries and header files in the default FreeBASIC installation directory.
If you wish to install to a different directory, type,

	make install INSTALLDIR=path

If your Linux build is set up as standalone you will need to install using this
command:

	make install INSTALLDIR=/prefix STANDALONE=1

In either case, the libraries will be installed under lib/<target>, where
<target> is one of win32, win64 or linux, and the header files will be placed in
inc/ext.

NOTE: path must be an absolute path. By default msys mounts drive C: at /c, so
the directory C:\mydir must be specified as /c/mydir.

Other options available to the makefile are:

	NDEBUG - use NDEBUG=1 to build the non-debug version of the library
	VERBOSE - VERBOSE=0 produces little output, VERBOSE=2 produces extra
		output, the default is VERBOSE=1.
	TARGET - not required on Linux or Windows, use TARGET=dos on DOS.
	PROFILE - use PROFILE=1 to add profiling information to the library.
	EXX - use EXX=1 to add null pointer and out of bounds checking.
	OPT - use OPT="other fbc options" to add options to the compilers
		command line.
	USE_MYSQL - Build the MySQL Database Driver, requires mysql/mysql.bi in include path.
	USE_POSTGRES - Build the Postgres Database Driver, requires postgres header in path.
	BITS - use BITS=32 or BITS=64 to override the default target

### Building the examples

After the libraries are built, you may wish to build the example programs
included in the package. Enter the root directory and type,

	make examples

This will build the example programs under <root>/examples.

## Uninstalling the libraries

To uninstall the FreeBASIC Extended Library, enter the root directory and type,

	make uninstall

If you installed the library in a different location using the INSTALLDIR
make option, then you must use the same option here, like,

	make uninstall INSTALLDIR=path

This will remove all of the installed files, but none of the directories
created under <path>.
